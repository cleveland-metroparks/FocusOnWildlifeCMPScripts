# This script calculates the "plurality" consensus of species
# classifications for Snapshot Serengeti images. Plurality
# simply means the species that garners the most votes
# regardless of whether or not that species gets at least half
# of all votes ("majority").
#
# Usage: plurality_consensus.py <infile> <outfile>
# <infile>  is a comma-separated value flat file as dumped
#           from the Zooniverse database.
# <outfile> is the file to be written to (.csv format) In this
#           file, each line represents a consensus species
#           within a subject. Subjects with just one species
#           will contain one line in this file. Subjects with
#           two species will contain two lines. Etc.
#
# Input file fields Snapshot Serengheti:
#  0  classification_id
#  1  user_hash
#  2  subject_zooniverse_id
#  3  capture_event_id
#  4  created_at_time

#  11 species_count
#  12 standing
#  13 resting
#  14 moving
