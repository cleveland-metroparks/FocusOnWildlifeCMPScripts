# Focus On Wildlife CMP Scripts

Scripts for processing Focus On Wildlife -- Cleveland Metroparks classification data

*Forked from similar scripts at Snapshot Serengeti* [Web link to GitHub repo](https://github.com/mkosmala/SnapshotSerengetiScripts)

These scripts will take the raw data produced by the citizen science project 
Focus On Wildlife -- Cleveland Metroparks and turn them into processed 
datasets that can then be used for analysis.

A description of all Snapshot Serengeti approach and datasets (raw dataset and processed datasets can be found here:
doi:10.5061/dryad.5pt92), the field methods, and uses for the data can be 
found in:
Swanson et al. 2015. Snapshot Serengeti - High-resolution annotated camera trap 
images of 40 mammal species in Serengeti National Park. Scientific Data.
